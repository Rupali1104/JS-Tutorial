// Summary:
// There are two types of arrays: holey arrays and continuous arrays. These arrays can contain three types of elements: SMI (Small Integer), Packed Element, and Double.

// 1. **Holey Array**: A holey array is an array that contains missing or empty elements. For example, [1, 2, , 4] is a holey array because it has a missing element. Holey arrays are less optimized for performance.

// 2. **Continuous Array**: A continuous array is an array that does not contain missing or empty elements. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4] is a continuous array because it has no missing elements. Continuous arrays are more optimized for performance.

// In terms of optimization, continuous arrays are more efficient and optimized for various operations compared to holey arrays.
